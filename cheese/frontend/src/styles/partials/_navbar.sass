//  Application-specific navigation bar styling should go in this file
//  As a combination of new styles, and override of defaults


// This mixin is itself a combination of mixins defined in framework/_navbar.sass.
// You can customize by:
//   * Overriding rules
//   * Including only the sub-mixins you care about
//   * Removing this include entirely and writing new rules
@include xng-navbar-defaults
