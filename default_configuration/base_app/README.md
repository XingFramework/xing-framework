The Xing Framework
===

Xing Application Base
---

The Xing Framework is a cutting edge web and mobile development platform by
Logical Reality Design, Inc.  It is designed to provide a completely modern
(and even somewhat future-proofed) API + SPA web development platform with
sensible defaults, solid conventions, and ease of rapid development. Xing uses
Rails (4.2) on the backend and AngularJS (1.4) on the frontend.  Most of the
problems inherent in getting these two frameworks to talk to each other cleanly
have been pre-solved in Xing.

The Xing Application Base contains the starting files for a new Xing Framework application.  Don't depend
on this repository - it is a temporary solution and will go away soon as we can move these into proper
templates.
