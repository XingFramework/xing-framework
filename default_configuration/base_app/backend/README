== Logical Reality Design CMS Framework

The goal of this project is a simple bare-bones CMS with editable
pages and locations (nav menu) and uploadable documents and images that
can all be controlled by an admin user.   Editing/management functions
are available in an admin/ namespace.

This project will be forked to create individual projects for clients;
the hope is that for many of those projects we can continue to pull changes
as they are made to the CMS.
