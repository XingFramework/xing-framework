All requests and responses are JSON. Client should send Accept:
"application/json" on all requests, and Content-Type: "application/json" on
requests with bodies (i.e. POST, PUT).

OPEN QUESTIONS:
  PATCH? Only makes sense if the body somehow represents a change rather than a replacement.
  All link relations? Or just self-links and use resource embed for
    relationships?

Server responses should represent resources as a JSON object with two fields:
`links` and `data`. Both fields should contain an object. The links object
should have fields equivalent to HTML "rel" attributes. Importantly the self
link, but we should define link types internal to the application.

The data object is more free form. Some commonality of fields is worthwhile,
but whatever most sensibly represents the resource is the best choice.

Where a resource refers to another, include a subset of the other resource in
the data object.
