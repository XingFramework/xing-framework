This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* Node/Npm Version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...

Also, it's good to let your team or open source contributors know your project is open and inclusive. One great way to do this is to have a [Code Of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for your project.
